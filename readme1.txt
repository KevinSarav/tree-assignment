There are no bugs or compilation/operating anomalies. 

The program is fairly straightforward. Run the assignment1.java class, and then type a string of 
letters. You must type more than one letter, or else the program will ask you to re-submit another input
of letters. The output will be properly formatted using the displayTree method in the Tree.java class from 
Listing 8.1 in the textbook.

Special Note: The test cases are in my HW1Report.doc file submitted through Blackboard. Scroll down to the 
section for Testing. I was not sure if you wanted us to fill out the whole report that we used for every assignment
in Data Structures I, but I did so, anyway. The test cases are in that report.
